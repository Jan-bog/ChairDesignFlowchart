## Sample cases:
- Case 1:
    1. There are many office chairs, not very many garden chairs in the market
    2. People who have gardens
    3. A garden chair resilient to weather conditions
    4. Since they own a garden, likely mid- to high-range
    5. Cap at $180
    6. Garden chair should be comfortable
    7. Just a garden chair in this case
    8. Set parameters accordingly
    9. Chair ended up at mid-end, settle for polycarbonate for higher resistance to the elements
    10. Go for 4 legs
    11. Place legs at edges, have them all intersect before reaching the base at the opposite edge
    12. Have them connect at the bottom for increased stability
    13. Settle for a flat seat
    14. Design the backrest to have an ergonomic shape given the straight bar constraints
    15. Idea: extend backrest into a small sunroof for the chair
    16. Produce prototype
    17. Prototype too heavy, no suitable replacement materials
    18. Refine design by removing leg base
    19. Weight acceptable
    20. Prototype comfortable
    21. Unacceptable durability
    22. Scrap the sunroof idea, remake prototype
    23. Weight acceptable
    24. Comfort reduced
    25. Change the angle of the backrest and re-add the base, as weight has also been reduced by removal of sunroof
    26. Remake prototype
    27. Weight acceptable
    28. Comfort acceptable
    29. Durability acceptable
    30. Profit margin acceptable
    31. Begin test production
    32. Issue with ergonomics for some people found
    33. Refine design by adjusting backseat height and angle, produce next prototype
    34. Weight acceptable
    35. Comfort acceptable
    36. Durability acceptable
    37. Profit margin acceptable
    38. Produce test units
    39. No issues found
    40. Submit for checking for compliance with laws and regulations

- Case 2:
    1. Not many high-end bar chairs
    2. Bars and restaurants
    3. High-end
    4. Cap at $350
    5. Practical application
    6. Not to be used at home
    7. To be used at a bar
    8. Set parameters accordingly
    9. Use carbon fiber
    10. Focus on design elements
    11. Give it six legs
    12. Place a leg at each edge and in the middle of each side
    13. Have the chair's seat be a triangle
    14. Go with the idea of a U-shaped seat
    15. Make backrest a flat rectangle
    16. Make the chair look like a tree branch?
    17. Produce prototype
    18. Weight acceptable
    19. Comfort unacceptable
    20. Decide to adjustshape of backrest
    21. Produce prototype
    22. Weight acceptable
    23. Comfort acceptable
    24. Durability acceptable
    25. Profitability acceptable
    26. Produce test units
    27. No issues with functionality found
    28. Submit for checking for compliance with laws
